President Donald Trump vowed on Thursday to campaign against Sen. Lisa Murkowski after the Alaska Republican said she was “struggling” with whether to support the president’s reelection bid.

Murkowski, whose next race is in two years, drew Trump’s ire earlier Thursday when she concurred with former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis’ sharp critiques of the president over his response to the death of George Floyd, an unarmed African American man, at the hands of police in Minneapolis, and the subsequent nationwide protests sparked by the killing.
